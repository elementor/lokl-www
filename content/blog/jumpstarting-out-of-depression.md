Having been in a depressive funk for several months now, it's time to publish
 the checklist I need in these times to help acknowledge and climb out of it.

When I'm feeling depressed or unproductive (the two are closely related for me),
 I'm mildly aware of the things I'm not doing, yet weirdly refuse to take
 action and get myself out of the rut.

By publishing this list, I hope to make it harder to avoid pulling myself out of
 similar funks in the future. To think that I won't fall into the funk again is
 naive, having had more regressions in past years, even with arguably ideal
 lifestyles and environments.

## My anti-depressive checklist

Are you doing at least a few of these today? Force yourself and you'll likely
 pull yourself up!

 - music: it becomes extremely difficult to be depressed while listening to some
 banging disco funk (ironically named genre for music therapy). This can help
 silence your ruminations enough to start the other items.
 - clean your physical/digital world: looking around at a messy environment is
 never a feelgood moment. Dishes, laundry, computer's Downloads directory all
 need a scrub. Too much stuff? De-clutter all non-essentials for your ideal life
 and give to the charity shop.
 - exercise: Lift heavy things. Go for a long walk or cycle with your headphones
 in. Say "f#^k you!" to the cortisol being spiked into your subconscious
 cocktail by the depression demon.
 - read a book: no, not a blog post, not the movie version. Focusing the mind
 on something should quieten the negative inner dialogue from snowballing. It
 should also help to read before sleeping vs exposing yourself to the light of
 electronic devices. 
 - study: something that helps your profession/artistry or some titilating 
 fiction. 
 - create: even if only for yourself, let the juices flow and write, draw, code,
 cook, dig or hammer some change into your world.
 - fasting: give your body some time to heal itself, whilst reducing the amount
 of meal prep and kitchen cleanup you need to do.
 - sex: what's not to enjoy? Being so depressed that it's of no interest to you
 is sad, but if you can convince yourself to get started, either by the joy you
 know it will bring your partner or simply as a good exercise and endorphin
 release, you'll soon be immersed in the experience and enjoying it. Relieving
 stress of your partner usually makes your own life easier, too!
 - following your path: if you're making great money at a job/industry you hate
 or are not working towards living the life you want, there's likely to be an
 underlying sense of unfulfilment. Overcome the challenges, like less money or
 less support from those around you and feel better living your life, not
 someone else's projections of how you should live.

## A negative watchlist

By repeating things I know aren't beneficial to me, it leads me downwards.

These are probably done for the quick endorphin releases, but are known signs
 I'm procrastinating and/or becoming depressed:

 - browsing social media: I don't need to know world headlines or see someone
 holding their Cosmo. Subscribing to RSS feeds or email gives me news relevant
 to my profession/artistry or personal interests. 
 - watching entertainment: in moderation, this can be great. When you are using
 it as an escape from living your life, it's just time that's been sucked away
 from your pursuit of fulfilment. Looking back at the last year, would you
 prefer to have spent all those hours watching entertaining shows/movies than
 to have done even mild exercise, study or create something? At least an
 audiobook while walking or cleaning is giving you some benefits at the same
 time.
 - eating terribly: chocolate or booze everyday are good danger signs that
 something needs to change. If you're not in a good place to be moderate,
 just throw out/give away that which you need to avoid. Not buying something is
 a lot easier than not grabbing it out of your cupboard.

## Find what makes sense to you

This is really just for my own benefit and something I can refer to when I'm
 in a depressive funk. If some of it works for you, great, but this is my
 soulful chicken soup recipe, find your own!
